# Plant Detection Module

## Overview

This folder contains scripts and modules for automated plant species identification using the [Plant.id API](https://plant.id/). The workflow enables batch processing of plant images, sending them to the API, and saving the identification results for further analysis.

---

## Features

- **Automated Plant Identification:**  
  Uses the Plant.id API to identify plant species from images.

- **Batch Processing:**  
  Processes multiple images in sequence (e.g., `left_plant_1.jpg`, `right_plant_1.jpg`, etc.).

- **Result Aggregation:**  
  All identification results are saved in a single text file for easy review.

- **API Key Security:**  
  The API key is stored in a separate `api_key.txt` file, which should not be committed to version control.

---

## Main Scripts

### `request_plant_species.py`

- Contains the `PlantIdentifier` class for handling API requests and formatting results.
- Encodes images, sends them to the Plant.id API, and parses the response.
- Provides a command-line interface for single-image identification.

### `batch_identify_plants.py`

- Loads the API key from `api_key.txt`.
- Iterates over a configurable range of image indices and both "left" and "right" image prefixes.
- Sends each image to the API and appends the formatted results to `results/all_plants_results.txt`.
- Handles missing images and logs errors in the results file.

## Model Used

- **Plant.id API Model:**  
  The identification is performed by the Plant.id API, which uses advanced machine learning models trained on a large dataset of plant images. The exact model architecture is proprietary to Plant.id, but it is designed for high-accuracy plant species recognition.

## Usage

1. **API Key:**  
   - Place your Plant.id API key in a file named `api_key.txt` in this folder.
   - Add `api_key.txt` to your `.gitignore` to keep it out of version control.

2. **Images:**  
   - Place your plant images in the `calib_images` folder.
   - Name them as `left_plant_1.jpg`, `right_plant_1.jpg`, etc.

3. **Run Batch Identification:**  
   ```
   python batch_identify_plants.py
   ```
   - Results will be saved in `results/all_plants_results.txt`.

---

## Output

- The results file contains, for each image:
  - Top species matches with confidence scores.
  - Scientific and common names.
  - Family, genus, and a short description.
  - Error messages for missing images.

---

## Notes

- The Plant.id API is a paid service with usage limits depending on your subscription.
- For more details on the API, see the [official documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24599534/2s93z5A4v2).
